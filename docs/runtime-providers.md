# Provider Layer

This document explains the layer where Anima talks to an underlying provider such as Codex CLI, Claude Code, or Kimi CLI.

It intentionally does not re-explain Slack routing, reminder scheduling, inbox ingestion, or the web app. Those are covered by `docs/design.md` and the architecture notes in `CLAUDE.md`.

## Mental Model

Anima has one durable primary session per Slack bot. Provider sessions are lower-level execution details under that primary session.

The runtime worker owns Anima inbox item execution:

1. claim a queued item;
2. build the current `RuntimeContext`;
3. use `AgentRuntimeBridge` to turn Anima context into provider-facing input;
4. call the configured provider adapter through `AgentRuntime.run`;
5. append same-session follow-up messages through `AgentRuntime.appendToActiveRun`;
6. mark items completed or failed;
7. close provider resources when the worker shuts down.

Provider adapters own only the protocol to the underlying CLI process. They do not receive inbox items, Slack channel/thread/DM objects, or agent state. They do not decide Slack eligibility, queue priority, reaction policy, prompt construction, or whether visible output should be posted. Visible Slack output still has to go through Anima tools from inside the spawned provider process.

The adapter boundary is:

```text
Anima context/state -> AgentRuntimeBridge -> provider-facing prompt/env/sinks -> provider adapter -> CLI process
```

## The Provider Contract

The contract lives in `server/providers/types.ts`.

```ts
export interface AgentRuntime {
  readonly env?: Record<string, string>;
  readonly kind: string;
  close?(): Promise<void>;
  run(input: AgentRuntimeInput): Promise<AgentRuntimeResult>;
  appendToActiveRun(input: AgentRuntimeFollowupInput): Promise<AgentRuntimeFollowupResult>;
}
```

`kind` identifies the provider and is also the key used for provider-session storage.

`run` is required. It starts or resumes provider work for one Anima inbox item and resolves when the provider work is done.

`appendToActiveRun` is required. It lets the worker send a newly queued same-session item into the active provider context instead of waiting for the active item to finish.

`close` is optional. It is for provider adapters that keep resources alive across items, such as a persistent child process.

### Runtime Input

`AgentRuntimeInput` contains:

- `itemId`: the Anima inbox item id, used as an Anima-side correlation key;
- `cwd`: the agent home directory for the child process;
- `env`: the complete child environment, already built by Anima;
- `prompt`: the text to send into the provider for this item;
- `systemPrompt`: optional runtime-profile text for providers that accept a separate system prompt;
- `providerSession`: the provider-native session id, if one exists;
- `signal`: an abort signal controlled by the worker for stop, idle timeout, and shutdown;
- `onActivity`: a heartbeat callback the provider calls when stdout/stderr activity arrives;
- `effects`: a sink for recording activities and persisting provider session ids.

The important boundary: `AgentRuntimeInput` does not contain inbox items, Slack channel/thread/DM objects, or agent state beyond the provider-facing prompt, environment, and effect sink.

The worker uses `onActivity` to reset the idle watchdog. If the provider produces no activity for the configured idle timeout, the worker aborts the item.

### Effects Sink

`AgentRuntimeEffects` is how provider adapters report provider events back to Anima:

- `recordRuntime`: runtime start/completion/failure;
- `recordOutput`: raw stdout/stderr chunks;
- `recordAgentText`: provider assistant text;
- `recordEvent`: provider lifecycle events such as compact or session stats;
- `recordToolStarted` / `recordToolFailed`: provider-side tool activity;
- `persistProviderSession`: provider-native session id updates.

The sink is Anima-aware; the adapter is not. `AgentRuntimeBridge` binds the sink to the current agent id, state dir, session, and runtime kind before calling the adapter.

### Runtime Result

`AgentRuntimeResult.text` is internal runtime output. It is useful for logs and inspection, but Anima does not post it to Slack automatically. The spawned code agent must call `anima message send` or `anima message update` for visible Slack side effects.

## How the Worker Uses Providers

`AgentRuntimeWorker` is the only caller of the provider contract in normal service execution.

For a claimed item:

1. `claimNextInboxItem` marks the first queued item as `running` and writes the worker id.
2. `runtimeContextForItemId` rebuilds the full runtime context.
3. `AgentRuntimeBridge` in `server/runtime/runtime-bridge.ts` builds provider-facing `prompt`, `env`, `providerSession`, and `effects`.
4. The worker starts a parallel follow-up loop while the active item is running.
5. The worker calls `agentRuntime.run(providerInput)`.
6. On success, the worker records completion and marks the item `completed`.
7. On error or abort, the worker records failure and marks the item `failed`.
8. `onItemSettled` runs after either path; the agent service uses it to remove processing reactions from the active item and any appended follow-up items.

Only one normal item can be `running` for an agent at a time. Follow-up items are temporarily claimed by the same worker while the active item is still running.

## Active-Run Follow-Up Protocol

Active-run follow-up append is Anima's way to preserve the "one teammate, one primary session" behavior while a provider is busy.

When a same-session message arrives during an active item:

1. ingestion creates a normal queued item for that message;
2. the active worker loop notices the queued item;
3. `claimNextFollowup` claims it for the same worker;
4. `AgentRuntimeBridge` builds a provider-facing follow-up input with `activeItemId`, follow-up `itemId`, and `prompt`;
5. the worker calls `agentRuntime.appendToActiveRun`;
6. if accepted, the follow-up item is marked `completed` immediately and gets a `runtime.followup_appended` activity;
7. if rejected, the item is requeued and will execute after the active item.

Accepted follow-up append means the provider adapter has taken responsibility for injecting that message into the active provider context. The follow-up item does not get its own independent provider execution.

This is why reaction cleanup runs for both the active item and accepted follow-up items: the human sees multiple Slack messages being worked on, but the provider sees one active execution context.

## Prompt Boundary

The shared prompt helpers live in `server/runtime/delivery-prompt.ts` and `server/runtime/standing-prompt.ts`. Provider adapters do not call them directly; `server/runtime/runtime-bridge.ts` calls them before invoking the adapter.

The Anima runtime profile tells the provider-side agent how Slack side effects work, which `anima` tools exist, and which environment variables are available. This is platform behavior, not provider-specific behavior.

The runtime profile is delivered through provider-native standing-prompt mechanisms. The per-item prompt contains only the current Slack or reminder event. It may include "Recovery context" when Anima does not have a persistent provider session yet. Recovery context is a safety net, not the product session model.

## Environment Boundary

`runtimeEnv` builds the child process environment. `AgentRuntimeBridge` calls it and passes the completed env to the adapter.

The important pieces are:

- `ANIMA_AGENT_ID` and `ANIMA_HOME`, so agent-facing CLI tools can locate config and state;
- configured provider env from the agent config;
- a `PATH` that includes Anima's agent-facing CLI.

`ANIMA_INBOX_ITEM_ID` is deliberately stripped from the long-lived provider environment. Slack-visible tools resolve the audited item at call time from `runtime/active-item.json`.

Provider code should not read Slack tokens directly. It should call `anima message`, `anima reminder`, or `anima subscription` so the side effect is audited against the current item.

## Provider Sessions

Provider session ids are stored on Anima's primary session record by provider kind. `AgentRuntimeBridge` reads the current provider session and passes it to the adapter as `providerSession`.

They are used to resume the underlying tool's native context:

- Codex: the stored id is the Codex thread id;
- Claude: the stored id is the Claude Code session id.

When a provider emits a new session id, the adapter calls `effects.persistProviderSession`. The sink updates Anima's primary session record.

Provider sessions are not the Anima product session. If a provider session is compacted, rotated, restarted, or replaced, Anima still has the durable primary session, inbox history, instructions, and activity log.

## Codex Adapter

Implementation: `server/providers/codex.ts`.

Current process model:

- Anima starts one persistent `codex app-server --listen stdio://` process for the runtime worker.
- The Codex thread id is persisted and resumed on later items.
- The process stays alive across Anima items until abort or worker shutdown.
- Anima sends the runtime standing prompt through Codex `developerInstructions`; each item input contains only the bridge-built delivery prompt.
- Thread start/resume explicitly sets `approvalPolicy: "never"`, `sandbox: "danger-full-access"`, optional `model`, and optional `config.model_reasoning_effort`.

Protocol:

1. send JSON-RPC `initialize`;
2. send `thread/start` or `thread/resume`;
3. persist the returned thread id as the `codex-cli` provider session;
4. send `turn/start` with the bridge-built delivery prompt;
5. collect `item/agentMessage/delta` notifications as internal text;
6. map provider tool notifications to Anima activities;
7. resolve when `turn/completed` arrives.

Active-run follow-up:

- Once `turn/start` returns a turn id, the adapter exposes that id as ready.
- `appendToActiveRun` sends `turn/steer` with `expectedTurnId`.
- If Codex accepts the request, the worker marks the new queued item completed as part of the active item.

Activity mapping:

- `item/started` can become `tool.call.started`;
- failed command/file/MCP/web-search items can become `tool.call.failed`;
- `contextCompaction` items become `runtime.event` `codex.compact.started` / `codex.compact.completed` / `codex.compact.failed`;
- `turn/completed` usage/model/status data becomes `runtime.event` `codex.session.stats`;
- assistant text deltas are accumulated and returned as internal `AgentRuntimeResult.text`.

## Claude Adapter

Implementation: `server/providers/claude.ts`.

Current process model:

- Anima starts one persistent `claude` process for the runtime worker.
- It uses stream-json input/output over stdio.
- It intentionally does not use `claude -p`.
- If Anima has a stored Claude session id, startup includes `--resume <session_id>`.
- The adapter sets `CLAUDE_CODE_AUTO_COMPACT_WINDOW=200000` by default; agent config `provider.env` can override it.
- The process stays alive across Anima items until abort or worker shutdown.

Command shape:

```text
claude
  --output-format stream-json
  --verbose
  --input-format stream-json
  --permission-mode bypassPermissions
  --disallowedTools AskUserQuestion,CronCreate,CronDelete,CronList,ScheduleWakeup,RemoteTrigger,PushNotification
  [--resume <session_id>]
  [--model <model>]
  [--effort <reasoningEffort>]
  --system-prompt-file <runtime prompt file>
```

### Provider Tool Policy

Anima uses provider tools for observability only; Slack side effects, reminders, subscriptions, inbox routing, and scheduling must stay Anima-owned. Claude Code currently receives a small strategic denylist through `--disallowedTools`:

| Tool | Current CLI presence | Stream-json behavior | Side effect | Decision |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `AskUserQuestion` | Claude Code built-in | Fails in the non-interactive runtime. | Attempts to ask the operator outside Anima. | Deny |
| `CronCreate` / `CronDelete` / `CronList` | Claude Code built-ins | Works as Claude-native session cron management. | Creates or manages recurring scheduled prompts outside Anima inbox/reminder/activity ownership. | Deny |
| `ScheduleWakeup` | Claude Code built-in | Works as Claude-native one-off delayed wake. | Creates future wakeups outside Anima reminders and audit. | Deny |
| `RemoteTrigger` | Claude Code built-in | Not needed by Anima runtime. | Establishes provider-native remote triggers outside Anima routing. | Deny |
| `PushNotification` | Claude Code built-in | Not needed by Anima runtime. | Sends provider-native notifications outside Anima-visible messaging. | Deny |
| `SlashCommand` | Claude Code built-in | Observe. Some commands are internal and may be valid in stream-json. | Can affect Claude session state, but not proven broken in Anima. | Allow/observe |
| File, shell, search, task, todo, notebook, and skill tools | Claude Code built-ins | Required for normal agent work. | Provider work, surfaced through Anima activity mapping. | Allow |
| Codex CLI tools | Codex app-server protocol | No equivalent user-question/scheduler controls found in the current adapter surface. | Tool activity is mapped by Anima. | Allow/observe |
| Kimi CLI tools | Kimi wire protocol | Anima initializes with `supports_question: false` and `supports_plan_mode: false`. | Tool activity is mapped by Anima. | Allow/observe |

The denylist is global for now. Per-agent tool policy should be added only when there is a concrete operator need; the default policy should keep provider-native scheduling and notifications out of the runtime.

Provider `run` protocol:

1. ensure the persistent Claude process exists;
2. mark the Anima item as active;
3. create a current provider controller;
4. write one bridge-built delivery prompt as a JSONL user message to Claude stdin:

   ```json
   {"type":"user","message":{"role":"user","content":[{"type":"text","text":"..."}]}}
   ```

5. stream Claude stdout through the JSONL activity mapper;
6. resolve the item on Claude `type: "result"`;
7. leave the Claude process open for the next Anima item.

Active-run follow-up:

- `appendToActiveRun` is accepted only when the requested active item id matches the adapter's current active item.
- Accepted follow-up input either writes another JSONL user message to the same Claude stdin or queues it behind the adapter's input gate.
- The input gate closes while Claude is compacting or while provider tool calls have not emitted matching `tool_result` items.
- Queued follow-up input is flushed only after compacting is done and outstanding provider tool calls are closed.

Compact and stats:

- `system/status` with `status: "compacting"` becomes `runtime.event` `claude.compact.started`.
- `system/compact_boundary` becomes `runtime.event` `claude.compact.completed`.
- `system/status` with `compact_result: "failed"` becomes `runtime.event` `claude.compact.failed`.
- `result` usage/model data becomes `runtime.event` `claude.session.stats`.

The web app reads the latest `claude.session.stats` activity to show model, context window, cache-read tokens, cache-create tokens, output tokens, terminal reason, and update time.

Abort behavior:

- Worker stop, idle timeout, or shutdown aborts the active item's signal.
- The Claude adapter responds by killing the persistent child process.
- The next item starts a fresh Claude process and resumes from the stored provider session id when possible.

Why stdout is not buffered:

- Persistent Claude sessions can run for a long time and produce large JSONL streams.
- `child-process.ts` supports `bufferOutput: false` so stream callbacks still run but stdout/stderr are not accumulated in memory.

## Agent Activities

Provider adapters write activities so the user can inspect what happened without reading raw provider logs.

Common runtime activities:

- `runtime.started`: provider process/transport began work;
- `runtime.completed`: provider work finished normally;
- `runtime.failed`: provider work threw or exited unsuccessfully;
- `runtime.aborted`: worker aborted the item because of `idle_timeout`, `shutdown`, or `user_stop`;
- `runtime.output`: raw stdout/stderr chunks when they are not parsed into richer records;
- `runtime.event`: provider lifecycle events such as compact and session stats.

Provider tool activities:

- `tool.call.started`: provider-side tool/action started;
- `tool.call.failed`: provider-side tool/action failed.

Agent text:

- `agent.text`: assistant text observed from provider stdout.

Slack tool activities are separate. When the spawned code agent calls `anima message send`, that goes through `server/slack/messages.ts` and records `tool.call.started` / `tool.call.completed` / `tool.call.failed` for the Slack side effect. Provider shell/Bash wrapper rows for first-class Anima CLI tools (`anima message read/send/update/react`, `anima file send`) are suppressed so the activity stream shows the semantic Slack tool row once.

## Current Boundaries and Tradeoffs

- Codex and Claude both keep provider continuity through a persisted provider session id and a persistent child process for the lifetime of the worker.
- Auto-compact is provider-owned. Anima observes compact events and records them; it does not perform compaction itself.
- Active-run follow-up append is best-effort. If a provider rejects a follow-up, the item is requeued and processed after the active item.
- An accepted follow-up item is considered absorbed by the active item. It will not have a separate provider result.
- A Claude item can span more than one provider `result` boundary when queued follow-up input is flushed at the boundary; Anima waits for the final provider result before completing the active item.
- Provider sessions are execution-layer state. The durable product session is still Anima's primary session plus inbox/activity history and home instructions.

## Adding Another Provider

A new provider should:

1. implement `AgentRuntime`;
2. set `kind` and optional `env`;
3. consume the bridge-provided `prompt`, `cwd`, `env`, `providerSession`, `signal`, and `effects`;
4. map provider stdout/stderr into `effects`;
5. persist provider session ids through `effects.persistProviderSession`;
6. implement `appendToActiveRun` using the provider's real in-flight input protocol;
7. implement `close` if it keeps a process or connection alive beyond a single item.

The worker should not need provider-specific changes for a new adapter.
