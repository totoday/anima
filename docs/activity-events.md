# Activity Tab — Events & Display Reference

How the Activity tab presents what an agent did. The activity log (`activity.jsonl`)
is an append-only curated audit: it keeps user-visible and diagnostic events, while
raw provider protocol frames are dropped before storage. This doc explains the
display layer on top of that log — **which persisted events surface, in which view,
and what each row shows**.

It describes current behavior, not a wishlist. Where a field genuinely isn't
available yet, it's called out under [Known gaps](#known-gaps).

Sources: emitters in `server/runtime/*`, `server/providers/*-events.ts`,
`server/tools/*`, `server/reminders/*`, `server/subscriptions/*`; display in
`web/src/lib/activities.ts`, `web/src/lib/activity-feed.ts`,
`web/src/views/agents/activity/*`.

## What the Activity tab is

The Activity tab is our **audited boundary made legible**: every persisted Slack
side effect, tool call, provider event, and runtime transition is turned into
something a human can actually read. The activity log is the source of truth for
the curated audit; the tab is a readable projection of it.

## Display principles

**1. Three tiers decide whether an event shows, and where.**

| Tier | Where it shows | What lives here |
|---|---|---|
| **Conversation** | Default view | What a human reads to follow what the agent *did*: its output, the files/commands/searches it touched, the messages it sent, reminders, subscriptions, failures. |
| **Audit** | "Show all steps" toggle on | Diagnostics worth having when inspecting but noise in the default narrative: session/usage stats, rate limits, retries, model reroutes, provider warnings, low-level lifecycle. |
| **Hidden** | Never rendered | Raw streaming/protocol frames, per-token deltas, `*.system.init`, `*.context.stats`, sanitized reasoning, legacy duplicate event names. Most of these are dropped before storage by design; if an old row exists, the UI never draws it. |

A second filter, **"Failed only"**, cross-cuts all tiers to show just failure rows.

**2. Each row is headline + the params that make it specific + the rest on expand.**

Every shown row is a one-line **headline** anyone can scan, the **1–2 params that
make it meaningful** inline (the query, the path, the command — not just the verb),
and, when the inline text is truncated or overflows, a **chevron to expand** the
full untruncated text. The expand reveals the full *content of that field* (the
whole command, the whole output), not a raw payload dump. Rows whose params fit
don't get a chevron; message/file rows show their full body inline already.

**3. Categories are by function; tier is orthogonal.**

The catalog below is grouped into five functional categories so it's navigable.
A category answers "what kind of thing is this event about"; the tier answers
"should it show by default". The two are independent — a category mixes
Conversation, Audit, and Hidden rows.

### 1. Run lifecycle & agent output

The agent's text output and the start/finish/fail/abort of a run.

| Event | When it fires | Tier | Shown inline | On expand |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `agent.text` | Provider emits final assistant text. | Conversation | `Output` + message text (truncated at 280 chars). | Full text. |
| `runtime.completed` | Runtime finishes an item successfully. | Conversation (subtle) | `Idle` — turn-end marker. | — |
| `runtime.failed` | Runtime throws or exits with an error. | Conversation | `Run failed` + first line of the error. | Full error. |
| `runtime.aborted` | Item aborted by shutdown, user stop, or idle timeout. | Conversation | Reason-mapped title: `Runtime restarted` / `Stopped by user` / `Idle timeout` / `Runtime stopped`. | — |
| `runtime.followup_failed` | Appending a follow-up to an active run failed. | Conversation | `Follow-up failed` + reason. | Full reason/error. |
| `runtime.started` | Runtime starts processing an item. | Audit | `Working` / `Message received`. | — |
| `runtime.pending` | Item arrived while another was active and couldn't be appended. | Audit | `Queued behind current item`. | — |
| `runtime.followup_appended` | Follow-up appended into an active run. | Audit | `Follow-up added to current run` + text snippet. | Full text. |
| `runtime.output` | Raw stdout/stderr from a provider child process. | Audit | `Process output` + `[stream]` + first line. | Full text. |
| `runtime.steered`, `runtime.steer_failed`, `runtime.provider_silent` | Legacy names predating the follow-up rename / watchdog diagnostic. | Hidden | — | — |

### 2. Provider tool calls

Files, shell, search, web, and planning/subagent helpers the provider invokes.
Provider tools currently emit a `started` row (used as the visible row) plus
failures; successful completion rows aren't emitted yet (see [Known gaps](#known-gaps)).

| Event | When it fires | Tier | Shown inline | On expand |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| File/code tools — `Read`, `ReadFile`, `ReadMediaFile`, `Write`, `WriteFile`, `Edit`, `Grep`, `Glob`, `WebFetch`, `FetchURL`, `fileChange`, `StrReplaceFile` (started) | Provider starts a file/read/edit/list/fetch tool. | Conversation | Verb (`Read` / `Wrote` / `Edited` / `Listed` / `Fetched`) + `target` (path / pattern). Edit rows can carry a diff on expand. | Full target/diff if truncated. |
| Shell — `Bash` / `shell` (started) | Provider runs a shell command. | Conversation | `Ran` + command (shell wrapper stripped, truncated at 120 chars). Anima CLI wrapper commands dedupe against the first-class `anima.*` row. | Full command. |
| Web search / research — `WebSearch`, `SearchWeb`, Codex `webSearch` (started) | Provider runs a web search. | Conversation | `Searched` + **the query** inline (reads `query`/`target`). | Full query. |
| Planning / delegation — `Agent`, `Skill`, `TaskCreate`, `TaskUpdate`, `TodoWrite`, `SetTodoList` (started) | Provider starts a helper tool. | Conversation | Mapped verbs: `Delegated to subagent` / `Ran skill` / `Created task` / `Updated task` / `Updated todos` (+ target/title/name). | Full target if truncated. |
| `ToolSearch` (started) | Provider searches its deferred tools. | Audit | `Searched tools`. | — |
| `tool.call.failed` (provider tools) | A provider tool errors or a command exits non-zero. | Conversation | `<verb> failed` + target/command + terse error. Failed shell leads with the command. | Full error. |
| `(missing)` legacy Kimi tool-calls without `payload.tool` | Pre-rename Kimi logs. | Hidden | — | — |

### 3. Slack actions

Messages, files, reactions, and reads the agent performs, plus the side-effect
wrappers around the actual Slack write. `started` rows are dropped — the
`completed`/`effect` row is the visible action, and the audited
`external.effect.*` row dedupes against the `anima.*` one.

| Event | When it fires | Tier | Shown inline | On expand |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `external.effect.completed:slack.ask.post` / `tool=anima.ask` | Agent posts a bounded Slack question with buttons. | Conversation | `Asked <person>` / `Asked anyone` + question + `[option / option]`; the plain raw `anima ask ...` shell row is deduped. | Full question/options target if truncated. |
| `choice_response` inbox item | A human clicks an ask option. | Conversation (inbound) | Inbound row from the answerer: `Selected: <option>` + original question; surface chip points to the original channel/thread/DM. | Full body shown inline. |
| Slack inbox item | Human message, mention, DM, or thread reply wakes the agent. | Conversation (inbound) | Actor + rendered message body, with Slack/usergroup/date/special mentions, emoji names, and both Slack `*bold*` and Anima `**bold**` handled. | Full body shown inline. |
| `anima.message.send` / `update` (completed), `external.effect.completed:slack.message.*` | Agent posts or edits a Slack message. | Conversation (message row) | `Replied` / `Replied in thread` / `Edited` + surface chip + full message body. Subtle warning badge when `warnings` present. | Full body shown inline. |
| `anima.file.send` (completed), `external.effect.completed:slack.file.send` | Agent sends one or more files. | Conversation (message row) | File row + caption + attachment cards. | Full body shown inline. |
| `anima.message.react` (completed), `external.effect.completed:slack.reaction` | Agent adds/removes a reaction. | Conversation (light) | Reaction glyph/name + surface chip; subtle `noop` ("already present/absent"). | — |
| `anima.message.read` (completed) | Agent reads Slack history or a thread. | Conversation | `Read messages` + channel · slice (`thread` / `around <time>` / `last N`) · message count. | Full target if truncated. |
| `anima.message.*` (failed), `external.effect.failed:slack.*` | A Slack message/file/react/read write fails. | Conversation | Product title (`Message failed` / `Edit failed` / `File upload failed` / `Reaction failed` / `Read failed`) + error, matched by tool or `effect`. | Full error. |
| `tool.call.started:anima.*`, `external.effect.started:slack.*` | The pre-write/started phase of any Anima Slack action. | Hidden (dropped) | — | — |

### 4. Reminders, subscriptions & session

Agent-owned schedules, channel/thread subscriptions, and provider-session rotation.

| Event | When it fires | Tier | Shown inline | On expand |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `anima.reminder.schedule` (completed) | Agent schedules a reminder. | Conversation | `Scheduled reminder` + title · `at <nextDueAt>`. | — |
| `anima.reminder.cancel` (completed) | Reminder cancelled. | Conversation | `Cancelled reminder` + title. | — |
| `anima.reminder.snooze` (completed) | Reminder snoozed. | Conversation | `Snoozed reminder` + `until <time>`. | — |
| `anima.reminder.fire` (completed) | Reminder wake fires and is enqueued. | Conversation | Consumed into the inbound row: `Reminder` / `Reminder · fire #N`. | — |
| `anima.reminder.list` (completed) | Agent lists its reminders. | Audit | `Listed reminders`. | — |
| `anima.reminder.*` (failed) | A reminder action fails. | Conversation | `Reminder <action> failed` + error. | Full error. |
| `anima.subscription.add` | A Slack mention creates a channel/thread subscription. | Conversation | `Subscribed to` + `#channel` · kind (`channel`/`thread`). | — |
| `anima.subscription.remove` | Agent removes a subscription. | Conversation | `Unsubscribed from` + `#channel`. | — |
| `anima.session.rotate` | User rotates the provider session from web/API. | Conversation | `Session rotated` + `Archived N provider sessions` · note. | — |
| `tool.call.started:anima.reminder.schedule` | The started phase of a schedule. | Hidden (dropped) | — | — |

### 5. Provider internals & diagnostics

Compaction, usage/rate-limit stats, retries, and raw streaming frames. Mostly
Audit or Hidden — these explain *how* the provider ran, not what the agent did.

| Event | When it fires | Tier | Shown inline | On expand |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `*.compact.completed` | Provider finishes context compaction. | Conversation (subtle) | `Context compacted` — explains a memory/continuity beat. | — |

| `*.session.stats` | Provider reports turn/session usage. | Audit | `Session stats` + model · context · cached · output. | — |
| `claude.rate_limit` | Claude reports rate-limit status. | Audit | `Rate limit updated` + status / type / reset when available. | — |
| `codex.rate_limits.updated` | Codex reports updated rate-limit windows. | Audit | `Rate limit updated` + limit label + reset. | — |
| `codex.model.rerouted` | Codex switches model mid-run. | Audit | `Model rerouted` + `from → to` + reason. | — |
| `codex.warning` (and warning variants) | Codex emits a warning/config/deprecation notice. | Audit | `Provider warning` + message/summary. | Full details. |
| `codex.protocol.invalid_json` | Codex writes a non-JSON line where JSON-RPC was expected. | Audit | Surfaces generically when flagged warning/failed. | Full error. |
| `claude.provider.retry` | Side-effect-free transient error; Anima retries the turn. | Audit | `Provider retry` + reason. | Full error. |
| `claude.provider.resume_retry` | Transient error after partial progress; Anima resumes instead of repeating side effects. | Audit | `Provider resume retry` + reason. | Full error. |
| `claude.session.resume_missing` | Stored provider session can't resume; a fresh one starts. | Audit | `Provider session expired` / `Started a fresh session`. | — |
| `kimi.approval.response` | Kimi approval prompt is answered. | Audit | `Approval answered` + response. | — |
| `kimi.step.interrupted` | A Kimi step is interrupted. | Audit | `Step interrupted`. | — |
| `*.context.stats` | Continuous mid-run context-window telemetry. | Hidden | — | — |

| `runtime.event:assistant`, `runtime.event:system.api_retry` | Legacy diagnostics, superseded. | Hidden | — | — |

## Known gaps

A few rows can't yet show everything because the field isn't emitted. These are
emission-side (backend), not rendering:

1. **Provider tool success carries no result.** Provider adapters emit
   `tool.call.started` + failures, but no `tool.call.completed` for *success*, so
   there's no result summary to attach to a tool row (search → N results, read →
   bytes/lines, fetch → status). Surfacing those needs a completed row (or a
   result attached to the started row).
2. **Some historical/unknown provider tools still lack a `target`.** Known
   file/shell/search tools now derive `target`/`command` where the provider gives
   enough input, but old rows and provider-specific tools outside the catalog can
   still fall back to a bare verb until their input shape is mapped.

> The Codex `webSearch` query — previously missing from the log — is now emitted,
> so the search query shows inline (the original "Research shows only Research"
> defect). Logged here as resolved for context.
